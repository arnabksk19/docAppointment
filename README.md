# Project Name

Welcome to **appointDoc**!

This project consists of a frontend and backend application. Below are the instructions to run each part of the project.

<section>

## Frontend

To run the frontend application, navigate to the `/client` directory and run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the frontend development server and make the application available at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Backend

To run the backend application, navigate to the root directory (`/`) and run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the backend server and make the API available at `http://localhost:3001` (or the port specified in the `package.json` file).

</section>
```

In this example, the `<section>` tags are used to semantically group the frontend and backend instructions. The terminal commands are placed within code blocks, making them easy to copy.
